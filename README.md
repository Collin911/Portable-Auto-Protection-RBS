In this paper, we proposed an auto-protection scheme for the resonant beam system, with which potential simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) could be realized. With our scheme, the intra-cavity laser can be automatically shut off when foreign objects invade into the optical path, leaving minimum radiance exposure onto the invading object, ensuring enhanced safety. We employed phase compensation scheme to ensure the availability under portable application scenario. 

To run the simulation for 2D lightwave field transmission, open *exp_V2.m*, setup parameters (there are also some global parameters in Para_FFTAlgorithm), and run. 
With the results obtained by exp_V2.m, additional SWIPT metrics can be calculated with *exp_SWIPT.m*
